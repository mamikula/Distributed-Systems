# Actors extend the Ray API from functions (tasks) to classes. An actor
# is essentially a stateful worker (or a service). When a new actor is instantiated,
# a new worker is created, and methods of the actor are scheduled on that specific
# worker and can access and mutate the state of that worker. Like tasks, actors
# support CPU, GPU, and custom resource requirements.

# Remote Classes (just as remote tasks) use a @ray.remote decorator on a Python class.

# Ray Actor pattern is powerful. They allow you to take a Python class and instantiate
# it as a stateful microservice that can be queried from other actors and tasks and
# even other Python applications. Actors can be passed as arguments to other tasks
# and actors.

# When you instantiate a remote Actor, a separate worker process is attached to a worker
# process and becomes an Actor process on that worker nodeâ€”all for the purpose of running
# methods called on the actor. Other Ray tasks and actors can invoke its methods on that
# process, mutating its internal state if desried. Actors can also be terminated manually
# if needed. The examples code below show all these cases.

# So let's look at some examples of Python classes converted into Ray Actors.

# Remote class as a stateful actor pattern
#
# Example 1: Method tracking
#
# Problem: We want to keep track of who invoked a particular method. This
# could be a use case for telemetry data we want to track.

# Let's use this actor to track method invocation of an actor methods. Each
# instance will track who invoked it and number of times.

# Note that we did not have to reason about where and how the actors are scheduled.
# We did not worry about the socket connection or IP addresses where these actors
# reside. All that's abstracted away from us.
# All we did is write Python code, using Ray core APIs, convert our classes into
# distributed stateful services

# Example 2: Parameter Server distributed application with Ray Actors
# Problem: We want to update weights and gradients, computed by workers,
# at a central server.
# Let's use Python class and convert that to a remote Actor class
# actor as a Parameter Server.
# This is a common example in machine learning where you have a central
# Parameter server updating gradients from other worker processes computing
# individual gradients.

# print('parameter server')

    def __init__(self):

        return self.params

    def update_params(self, grad):
        # Update the gradients

# Define a worker or task as a function for a remote Worker. This could be a
# machine learning function that computes gradients and sends them to
# the parameter server.

    # Iterate over some epoch

        grad = np.ones(10)
        # update the gradients in the parameter server
        ps.update_params.remote(grad)

# Start our Parameter Server actor. This will be scheduled as a worker process
# on a remote Ray node. You invoke its ActorClass.remote(...) to instantiate an
# Actor instance of that type.

# param_server = ParameterSever.remote()
# print(param_server)

# Let's get the initial values of the parameter server
# print(f"Initial params: {ray.get(param_server.get_params.remote())}")

# Create Workers remote tasks computing gradients
# Let's create three separate worker tasks as our machine learning tasks
# that compute gradients. These will be scheduled as tasks on a Ray cluster.

# You can use list comprehension.
# If we need more workers to scale, we can always bump them up.
# Note: We are sending the parameter_server as an argument to the remote worker task.

# print([worker.remote(param_server) for _ in range(3)])

# Now, let's iterate over a loop and query the Parameter Server as the
# workers are running independently and updating the gradients

# for _i in range(20):
#     print(f"Updated params: {ray.get(param_server.get_params.remote())}")

# Tree of Actors Pattern
# A common pattern used in Ray libraries Ray Tune, Ray Train, and RLlib
# to train models in a parallel or conduct distributed HPO.

# In this common pattern, tree of actors, a collection of workers as actors, are
# managed by a supervisor actor. For example, you want to train multiple models,
# each of a different type, at the same time, while being able to inspect its
# state during its training.

# Example: Supervisor and worker actor pattern
# Generic model factory utility
# This factory generates a few specify type of models (they are fake):
# regression, classification, or neural network, and will have its respective
# training function. Each model will be in a particular state during training.
# The final state is DONE.

# Factory function to return an instance of a model type
def model_factory(m: str, func: object):
    return Model(m, func)

# states to inspect or checkpoint

        self._func = func

    def train(self):
        # do some training work here for the respective model type
        self._func()

#This worker actor will train each model. When the model's state reaches DONE, we stop training

@ray.remote
class Worker(object) :
    def __init__(self,m: str,func: object) :
        # type of a model: lr, cl, or nn
        self._model=m
        self._func=func

    # inspect its current state and return it. For now
    # it could be in one of the states
    def state(self) -> str :
        return random.choice(STATES)

    # Create the model from the factory for this worker and
    # do the training by invoking its respective objective function
    # for that model
